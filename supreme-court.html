                <h2>Supreme Court of India</h2>
                <p>The Supreme Court of India, established in 1950, is the highest judicial authority in the country and serves as the guardian of the Constitution. Located in New Delhi, it is tasked with upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice. The Supreme Court consists of a Chief Justice and a maximum of 34 other judges, all appointed by the President of India. Its primary functions include adjudicating disputes, interpreting the Constitution, and safeguarding fundamental rights. As the apex court, its decisions are binding on all lower courts in the country, making it a crucial institution in the Indian judiciary.<br>

                    <br>One of the key roles of the Supreme Court is its power of judicial review, which allows it to invalidate laws and executive actions that are inconsistent with the Constitution. This power serves as a check on the legislative and executive branches, ensuring that they do not exceed their authority or infringe upon the rights of citizens. The Supreme Court has been instrumental in addressing significant constitutional issues, such as the protection of fundamental rights, the right to equality, and the right to life and liberty. Its landmark judgments have shaped the legal and social landscape of India, addressing critical issues ranging from environmental protection to social justice.<br>
                    
                    <br>The Supreme Court also plays a vital role in hearing public interest litigations (PILs), allowing individuals and organizations to seek justice on behalf of marginalized and underprivileged sections of society. This mechanism has empowered citizens to address broader societal issues, such as environmental degradation, human rights violations, and access to basic services. Through PILs, the Supreme Court has emphasized its commitment to social justice and the need for accountability from the state and public authorities.<br>
                    
                    <br>Additionally, the Supreme Court has a significant appellate jurisdiction, hearing appeals from the decisions of High Courts and other tribunals. Its rulings often set legal precedents, providing clarity and guidance on various legal matters. The Supreme Court's role in interpreting laws and the Constitution ensures the coherence of the legal system, enabling it to adapt to changing societal needs and challenges. Overall, the Supreme Court of India stands as a beacon of justice and constitutional governance, embodying the aspirations of the people and reinforcing the foundations of democracy in the country..</p><br>
